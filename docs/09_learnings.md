# Learnings

This project provided practical exposure to real-world cloud engineering concepts.  
Key learnings include:

## 1. Serverless Architecture Principles
- Stateless functions  
- Event-driven compute  
- Cold starts vs warm starts  
- Scaling based on concurrent invocations  

## 2. DynamoDB NoSQL Design
- Partition key importance  
- Data modeling for microservices  
- Efficient write operations  

## 3. API Gateway Design
- Route management  
- CORS configuration  
- Lambda proxy integration  

## 4. FastAPI in Serverless Environments
- Using Mangum as an adapter  
- Validation via Pydantic models  
- Request-response patterns  

## 5. IAM Least-Privilege Design
- Attaching only required permissions  
- Avoiding wildcard policies  
- Understanding security boundaries  

## 6. Deployment and Packaging
- Structuring Lambda zip packages  
- Managing Python dependencies  
- Testing APIs using console and Postman  

## 7. Frontend Integration with Backend APIs
- Fetch API usage  
- Error handling and fallback  
- Graceful degradation (demo mode)  

## 8. Production-Ready Code Practices
- Architecture thinking  
- Logging and monitoring  
- Decoupling frontend and backend  
- Designing for future enhancements  

Overall, this microservice strengthened cloud, backend, and deployment skills.
